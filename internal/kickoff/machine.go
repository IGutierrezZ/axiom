// never writes anything (D-08). Artifacts carries the digest already
// computed by the caller (ArtifactDigest) for each governed artifact,
// keyed "spec" | "design" | "tasks" | "tasks.<role>" (role lowercased); an
// absent or empty digest means that artifact has not reached "done" yet.
// RolePending carries each role's current pending task count from
// multirole.CountTasks; a role absent from this map is treated as unknown,
// never as "0 pending".
