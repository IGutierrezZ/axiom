// conventional RED test: tasks.md 11.1 requires it to capture the
// StatusV2Projection JSON a change with NO kickoff.yaml already produces
// today, confirmed green against the unmodified tree BEFORE governance.go
// exists or status.go/status_v2.go are touched (Phases 12-14). Every one of
// those later phases re-runs this exact test and must keep it green,
// unchanged, as its V-E evidence: D-05 requires the unsealed case to be
// byte-for-byte indistinguishable from before this increment, including the
// structural absence of the "governance" key.
//
// The workspace root varies every run (t.TempDir()), so it is the only
// substring scrubbed from both the actual and the frozen golden text before
// comparing; every other byte -- key order, field presence, indentation --
// is compared literally.
