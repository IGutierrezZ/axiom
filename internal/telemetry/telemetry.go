// Package telemetry implements Gentle AI's anonymous, opt-out usage
// telemetry (issue #4309). It knows how many installs stay alive and how
// they use the review pipeline, without collecting anything about the user,
// their code, or their machine identity.
//
// The package is intentionally a leaf: it must not import internal/cli or
// internal/app, both of which import it (internal/app also imports
// internal/cli), so any input it needs that would otherwise come from those
// packages (the build version, the RDD kill-switch reading) is passed in by
// the caller instead of resolved here.
