// gateArtifactDigest resolves the digest a recorded GateRecord must carry
// for it to be judged consistently by resolveGateStatus (machine.go, D-08)
// against the SAME digest internal/sddstatus's own loadGovernance
// recomputes at every status read. The two computations must resolve the
// exact same file set for the exact same gate key, or a genuine rejection
// with no remediation would spuriously "reopen" to pending the moment
// status is re-read (the defect this function exists to close) — see
// sdd_gate_artifact_digest_test.go's own RED reproduction.
//
// It mirrors, file for file, the resolution
// internal/sddstatus/status.go's resolveArtifactPaths/findSpecFiles and
// internal/sddstatus/governance.go's governanceArtifactInputs already
// apply: design.md and tasks.md as single files, specs/**/spec.md
// (sorted, alphabetically) with a flat spec.md fallback for the "spec"
// gate, and a role-apply:<rol> gate's own sealed TasksFile. The
// "integration" gate is deliberately excluded: machine.go's EvaluateGates
// never judges it against any digest (it always passes "" for that gate),
// so this function must not invent one either — doing so would create the
// exact same kind of mismatch this fix is closing.
//
// An artifact that does not exist yet, or exists but is empty, resolves to
// "" (no digest) — the same "not done yet" contract
// kickoff.Inputs.Artifacts documents, and exactly what sddstatus's own
// setGovernanceArtifactDigest leaves absent from its map for the same
// reason. It is never an error for gate record to run against an artifact
// that has not been produced yet: the four fixed gates never required a
// sealed kickoff.yaml or an existing artifact before this fix, and that
// contract does not change here.
