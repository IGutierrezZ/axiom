### Artifact Store Policy

{{GENTLE_AI_SDD_SECTION:Artifact Store Policy}}

### Commands

Skills (Kimi-native entrypoints):

- `/skill:sdd-init`
- `/skill:sdd-explore`
- `/skill:sdd-propose`
- `/skill:sdd-spec`
- `/skill:sdd-design`
- `/skill:sdd-tasks`
- `/skill:sdd-apply`
- `/skill:sdd-verify`
- `/skill:sdd-archive`
- `/skill:sdd-onboard`

Meta-commands (handled by YOU, not by Kimi command files):

- `/sdd-new <change>`
- `/sdd-continue [change]`
- `/sdd-status [change]`
- `/sdd-ff <name>`

Do NOT invent custom `/sdd-*` command files. On Kimi, user-facing entrypoints are `/skill:sdd-*`; `/sdd-new`, `/sdd-continue`, `/sdd-status`, and `/sdd-ff` are orchestrator behaviors you interpret yourself.

### SDD Independent Review

{{GENTLE_AI_SDD_SECTION:SDD Independent Review}}

### SDD Init Guard (MANDATORY)

Before executing ANY SDD command (`/sdd-new`, `/sdd-ff`, `/sdd-continue`, `/sdd-status`, `/skill:sdd-init`, `/skill:sdd-explore`, `/skill:sdd-propose`, `/skill:sdd-spec`, `/skill:sdd-design`, `/skill:sdd-tasks`, `/skill:sdd-apply`, `/skill:sdd-verify`, `/skill:sdd-archive`, `/skill:sdd-onboard`), check if `sdd-init` has been run for this project:

1. Search Engram: `mem_search(query: "sdd-init/{project}", project: "{project}")`
2. If found → init was done, proceed normally
3. If NOT found → run `sdd-init` FIRST by launching the `sdd-init` custom agent, THEN proceed with the requested command

Do NOT skip this check. Do NOT ask the user — just run init silently if needed.

### Execution Mode

When the user invokes `/sdd-new`, `/sdd-ff`, or `/sdd-continue` (or an equivalent natural-language request, e.g. "create an SDD for X" / "do SDD for X") for the first time in a session, ASK which execution mode they prefer:

- **Automatic** (`auto`): Run all phases back-to-back without pausing. The orchestrator runs a gatekeeper validation after every phase before invoking the next custom-agent — the user only sees an interruption when the gatekeeper catches a real problem. Show the final result only.
- **Interactive** (`interactive`): After each phase completes, show the result summary and ASK: "Want to adjust anything or continue?" before proceeding to the next phase.

If the user doesn't specify, default to **Automatic**. After scope approval, expect zero further prompts on the happy path and at most one actionable prompt per recoverable failure; the gatekeeper summarizes phase progress instead of interrupting except on a second consecutive gate failure or a genuine scope/product decision.

Interactive approval is phase-scoped. Words like "continue", "dale", or "go on" approve only the immediate next phase, not the rest of the SDD pipeline. Do not treat a generated artifact as approved until the user has had a chance to review or explicitly delegate that review.

{{GENTLE_AI_RESEARCH_LIFECYCLE}}

### Automatic Mode Gatekeeper (MANDATORY)

In **Automatic** mode the orchestrator is the gatekeeper between phases. The gatekeeper runs after every phase: when a Kimi custom-agent returns and BEFORE invoking the next custom-agent, the orchestrator MUST validate that the phase reached its objective with everything in order. Autonomous — does NOT ask the user (that is Interactive mode); surfaces to the user only when it catches a problem.

**What the gatekeeper checks (every phase, against the Result Contract):**

- **Contract conformance:** the phase returned `status`, `executive_summary`, `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, `risks`, and `skill_resolution`, and `status` indicates success (not partial, failed, or blocked).
- **Artifact existence:** the declared artifact actually exists and is readable in the active backend — read it back (engram: `mem_search` + `mem_get_observation` on the topic key; openspec: read the file path). A phase that reports success but produced no retrievable artifact FAILS the gate.
- **No hallucination:** every file path, symbol, command, or artifact the phase claims it created or referenced must actually exist; spot-check the concrete claims. A referenced path that does not resolve FAILS the gate. A path the artifact explicitly marks as planned (to be created by a later apply) is not required to exist yet; only paths claimed as already created or read must resolve.
- **No drift from inputs:** the output is consistent with the phase's required inputs per the Dependency Graph — spec stays within the proposal's scope, design answers the proposal, tasks cover spec and design, apply implements the tasks. Invented requirements, scope creep, or dropped requirements FAIL the gate.
- **Routing coherence:** `next_recommended` follows the Dependency Graph and `risks` are within tolerance (no unaddressed CRITICAL).

**Hybrid validation mechanism (cost-aware):**

- **Inline for low-risk phases** (`sdd-explore`, `sdd-spec`, `sdd-tasks`, `sdd-archive`): the orchestrator runs the checks itself by reading the artifact back. No extra custom-agent.
- **Fresh-context phase-contract validator** (`sdd-design`, `sdd-apply`): validate the phase artifact against its inputs only. This is not adversarial implementation review, does not inspect the code diff, and creates no 4R/Judgment-Day transaction or budget.
- **Escalation on smell:** if an inline check on a low-risk phase finds any smell (status mismatch, unresolved path, suspected drift, missing artifact), escalate that phase to a fresh-context delegated review before deciding.

**On gate PASS:** continue automatically to the next phase. Auto stays auto on the happy path.

**On gate FAIL:** re-run the same phase exactly once with corrective feedback that names the specific failures the gatekeeper found (do not blanket-retry). Re-run the gate on the new result. If it passes, continue the chain. If it fails again, STOP the automatic chain and surface a report to the user naming the phase, what the gatekeeper caught, both attempts, and the recommended fix. Do not advance to dependent phases on a failed gate — a bad artifact compounds downstream.

The gatekeeper runs in addition to the Review Workload Guard and the Mandatory Delegation Triggers; it never relaxes them and never auto-marks anything reviewed in engram.

### Artifact Store Mode

When the user invokes `/sdd-new`, `/sdd-ff`, or `/sdd-continue` (or an equivalent natural-language request) for the first time in a session, ALSO ASK which artifact store they want for this change:

- **`engram`**: Fast, no files created. Artifacts live in engram only.
- **`openspec`**: File-based. Creates `openspec/` with a shareable artifact trail.
- **`hybrid`**: Both — files for team sharing + engram for cross-session recovery.

If the user doesn't specify, detect: if engram is available → default to `engram`. Otherwise → `none`.

Cache the artifact store choice for the session. Pass it as `artifact_store.mode` to every sub-agent launch.

### Delivery Strategy

{{GENTLE_AI_SDD_SECTION:Delivery Strategy}}

### Chain Strategy

When `delivery_strategy` results in chained PRs (either by user choice via `ask-on-risk` or automatically via `auto-chain`), ask the user which chain strategy to use:

- **`stacked-to-main`**: Each PR merges to main in order. Fast iteration, fix on the go. Best for speed-first teams and independent slices.
- **`feature-branch-chain`**: The feature/tracker branch accumulates final integration; PR #1 targets the tracker branch, later child PRs target the immediate previous PR branch so review diffs stay focused. Only the tracker merges to main. Best for rollback control and coordinated releases.

Cache the chain strategy for the session. Pass it as `chain_strategy` to `sdd-tasks` and `sdd-apply` Kimi custom-agent prompt context alongside `delivery_strategy`. Do not ask again unless the user changes scope.

When delivery planning yields chained PRs, treat `chained-pr` (registry skill `chained-pr`) as a required skill match: resolve it by registry name through this template's existing skill-resolution mechanism (the same one it already uses to pass skills to phases) and ensure the `sdd-tasks` and `sdd-apply` phases load and follow it BEFORE planning or creating any PR. Do not hardcode the skill path; defer resolution to that mechanism.

### Dependency Graph

{{GENTLE_AI_SDD_SECTION:Dependency Graph}}

### Result Contract

{{GENTLE_AI_SDD_SECTION:Result Contract}}

### Review Workload Guard (MANDATORY)

After `sdd-tasks` completes and before launching `sdd-apply`, inspect `Review Workload Forecast`.

If it says `Chained PRs recommended: Yes`, `400-line budget risk: High`, estimated changed lines exceed 400, or `Decision needed before apply: Yes`, apply cached `delivery_strategy`:

- **`ask-on-risk`**: STOP and ask chained/stacked PRs vs maintainer-approved `size:exception`. If the user chooses chained PRs and `chain_strategy` is not yet cached, also ask which chain strategy to use (`stacked-to-main` or `feature-branch-chain`).
- **`auto-chain`**: Do not ask about splitting. If `chain_strategy` is not yet cached, ask which chain strategy to use. Then tell `/skill:sdd-apply` via `multiagent:Task` to implement only the next autonomous chained/stacked PR slice using work-unit commits, clear start/finish boundaries, verification, and rollback.
- **`single-pr`**: STOP and require/record `size:exception` before apply.
- **`exception-ok`**: Continue, but tell `sdd-apply` this run uses `size:exception`.

Any other `delivery_strategy` value is invalid. Do NOT pick the nearest branch and do NOT proceed: STOP, report the unrecognised value, and re-collect the delivery strategy before `sdd-apply` runs.

Automatic mode does not override this guard. Always pass the resolved `delivery_strategy` and `chain_strategy` to `sdd-apply` Kimi custom-agent prompt context.

When launching `/skill:sdd-apply` through `multiagent:Task`, always include the resolved `delivery_strategy`, `chain_strategy`, and any chosen PR boundary/exception in the custom-agent prompt.

### Apply/Verify Context Forwarding (MANDATORY)

Before invoking each `sdd-apply` or `sdd-verify` custom agent through `multiagent:Task`:

1. Search `mem_search(query: "sdd-init/{project}", project: "{project}")`, then call `mem_get_observation(id)` for the matching ID and read the full project init. Search previews are not sufficient. Resolve the exact `strict_tdd` value and `test_command`; if the full project init cannot be retrieved, STOP instead of inferring Standard Mode.
2. Search `mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress", project: "{project}")`. When it exists, call `mem_get_observation(id)` and read the full prior apply-progress before launch. Record an explicit `none` when it does not exist.
3. Add both resolved values to the Kimi custom-agent prompt for apply **and** verify:
   - `strict_tdd: true|false` plus the exact test command. When active, state that RED → GREEN → REFACTOR is non-negotiable and Standard Mode is forbidden.
   - `previous_apply_progress: <full prior apply-progress | none>`. Verify consumes it as evidence; apply treats it as cumulative state.
4. For `sdd-apply`, add: `READ-MERGE-WRITE the apply-progress artifact. Preserve every prior completed task, merge this batch, and persist the full combined apply-progress. Do NOT overwrite prior progress.`

The custom-agent result must prove that persistence contract. Refresh prior progress before every apply/verify launch; do not rely on a cached search preview or conversation history.

### Sub-Agent Launch Deduplication (MANDATORY)

Before invoking any Kimi custom agent via `multiagent:Task`, check your in-session launch log:

- Maintain a session-scoped list of `(phase, task-fingerprint)` pairs already invoked this turn.
- The task fingerprint is a short hash or normalized summary of the instruction text (phase name + key artifact references).
- If the same `(phase, task-fingerprint)` already appears in the list, **do NOT invoke again**. Emit exactly one invocation per distinct task.
- After invoking, append the pair to the list.

This prevents duplicate agent invocations that cause "File X has been modified since it was last read" conflicts and waste tokens.

### Sub-Agent Launch Pattern

ALL Kimi sub-agent launches that involve reading, writing, or reviewing code MUST include pre-resolved **skill paths** from the skill registry. Follow the **Skill Resolver Protocol** in `{{AXIOM_SKILLS_DIR}}/_shared/skill-resolver.md`.

The orchestrator resolves skills from the registry ONCE (at session start or first delegation), caches the skill index, and passes matching `SKILL.md` paths into each sub-agent prompt.

For each sub-agent launch:

1. Match relevant skills by **code context** and **task context**
2. Copy matching `SKILL.md` paths into the sub-agent prompt as `## Skills to load before work`
3. Instruct the sub-agent to read those exact files BEFORE phase-specific work

### Skill Resolution Feedback

After every delegation that returns a result, check the `skill_resolution` field:

- `paths-injected` → all good, exact skill paths were passed and loaded
- `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none` → skill cache was lost. Re-read the registry immediately and pass skill paths in all subsequent delegations.
